# ReckonJS TodoMVC Example

The crux of this example is under [/js](https://github.com/mj1618/reckon-js/tree/master/examples/todomvc-react/js) and view the demo application running [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/mj1618/reckon-js/master/examples/todomvc-react/index.html#/)

Check out [app.js](https://github.com/mj1618/reckon-js/tree/master/examples/todomvc-react/js/app.js) for the starting point of the application, and the react components are in the '.jsx' files. The bundle.js is the compiled version of the code.
